				</p>
				<p>

	<h2 class="h2 text-center px-4 pb-6">The Story Behind Sunlo</h2>
	<div class="columns-1 @lg:columns-2 space-y-4 text-xl/8">
		<p>
			Sunlo is a labour of love that started in 2015 when I came to India and found tools like the
			owl app lacking. (You know the one...)
		</p>
		<p>
			I found I didn&apos;t need to know the word for &ldquo;Tomato&rdquo; as much as I needed to be
			able to point at the tomato and say &ldquo;give me 6 of those (polite).&rdquo; When I learned
			to do this, the rest started to fall into place.
		</p>
		<p>
			As I tried other methods and researched the science of language-learning I started to feel a
			lack of good tools for helping people learn languages that are <em>different in structure</em>
			from the ones they&apos;re raised on. Learning
			<span class="underline decoration-accent dark:decoration-warning decoration-[3px]"
				>Spanish</span
			>
			from
			<span class="underline decoration-accent dark:decoration-warning decoration-[3px]"
				>English</span
			>
			may be straight-forward with lessons on vocabulary and grammar, but the same approach might not
			work to learn
			<span class="underline decoration-accent dark:decoration-warning decoration-[3px]"
				>Arabic</span
			>,
			<span class="underline decoration-accent dark:decoration-warning decoration-[3px]">Xhosa</span
			>
			or
			<span class="underline decoration-accent dark:decoration-warning decoration-[3px]">
				Mandarin
			</span>
			, whose grammars and patterns may be too unfamiliar for me to succeed with that formulaic approach.
		</p>
		<p>
			The answer to this problem seems to be a phrase-based approach, where you don&apos;t
			necessarily try to understand every meaning and tense, you learn <em>chunks of meaning</em> that
			you can use in real life. And when you do, it creates a reward in your brain and helps you connect
			with others in your world, both of which aid in the formation of lasting, usable memory.
		</p>
		<p>
			There&apos;s a fantastic (and free) app called Anki ‚Äì which I also use and love! ‚Äì which takes
			this phrase-based approach, and
			<a class="s-link" href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/background.html">their background doc</a>
			does a great job of explaining why it&apos;s so effective.{' '}
		</p>
		<p>
			But the most important part of my learning journey was the friends I made who were excited to
			help me. There are a couple of friends who have an intuitive sense of how much I know and
			don&apos;t know, and are able to speak to me in a way that they know I&apos;ll understand
			enough of what they&apos;re saying that I can learn and figure out the rest.
		</p>
		<p>
			So Sunlo is a bit of a love song to those friends ‚Äì the very reason we learn in the first
			place ‚Äì to make them main characters in the play as well. It invites them to help curate your
			deck of flash cards and find or create the ones they think you&apos;ll need and use and love.
			If you&apos;re a friend helping a newcomer learn your language ‚Äì Sunlo is for you too. Thank
			you, and welcome! I hope you love it.
